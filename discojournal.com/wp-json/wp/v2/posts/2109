For example, if I&#8217;m also a very anti-capitalist person, but then at the end of the day, I&#8217;m also feeding into the capitalistic logics of society, you know. So there&#8217;s this constant conflict that I&#8217;m making\u2026 I&#8217;m trying to find, trying to draw my line, how much I can make peace with and how much is a total no-go.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<cite><em>Conversation with Z, 2023<\/em><\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m on a train from London to Bath. The internet on my phone is spotty. I ask to connect to the train Wi-Fi and it redirects me to a sign-up page. I sigh. The ask is transactional; I knew I would have to pay in some way for the pleasure of getting online, if not in money (my train fare notwithstanding). The form wants to know my name. It wants to know my age. It really wants to know my gender, and whether I live in the UK. It\u2019s going to need an email address from me, sorry, if I really want to get online.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m not in the mood to comply. Refusal is already bubbling up through my throat, and my fingers pause over the keyboard, twitching and annoyed. So I don\u2019t. The name I put down is nonsense, a keysmash; the surname is too. My date of birth becomes the 1st of April, 2004, nowhere close to my real one. (I know all the system really needs to know is that I\u2019m above eighteen. I feed it what it wants, but give it nothing of value.) There are only two options for gender \u2013 man, woman \u2013 I pick one at random. My email address is an old one formed during my pre-teen online flash game heydays, a combination of the words \u2018game\u2019, \u2018master\u2019, and a string of numbers. It doesn\u2019t really matter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The system is satisfied. I answered its questions. It lets me get online. I feel, for a moment, triumphant at my refusal, my participation in the system in order to subvert it. I then immediately feel silly. It\u2019s just a web form for a Wi-Fi connection. It\u2019s not a big deal. It doesn\u2019t really matter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>\u201cWell, being trans and being queer means\u2026 (laughs). Well, I think of it in a certain way. It&#8217;s like when you are playing a game. Some simple options are handed out to you. OK, well, how far do you want this slider? Like, four or five sliders are given to you. How do you want to manage your life and how do you want to customise your life, if you will. Being queer feels like living life on advanced settings. It&#8217;s so many things you have to check and options, and you have to manually reset and set and check and think about what you have never thought about in life, which many people don&#8217;t have to think about in life. Because it\u2019s already taken care of for them. It&#8217;s already good for them. Why do they want to change? But I don&#8217;t blame them for not wanting to change it. But I also can because they \u2013 they did not want anybody to access those advanced options. So yeah, that&#8217;s how I kind of view queerness. It&#8217;s kind of this juggling of, like, multiple sliders. Like I want this much, and I want that much\u2026 I want to breathe this much air. I want to walk like this. I want to talk like this.

It reminds me of what @park_slope_arsonist, an online comedian whom I\u2019ve been following for many years, always says: I love to lie online. Why wouldn\u2019t you lie online? she asks. Why wouldn\u2019t you confound, contradict, create a persona that may or may not have anything to do with who you are when you\u2019re not online?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to get online \u2013 something stood in the way \u2013 I resented it for standing in the way \u2013 I messed with it in turn, while still getting what I wanted out of it. But perhaps these small moments of refusal, of a lack of compliance, pave the way for more deliberate acts of illegibility, of gaming the system to escape it, of thwarting surveillance. A month before I was on that train to Bath, I was back home in India, attempting to organise a Palestine solidarity reading circle with some friends while evading governmental scrutiny and a police shutdown, which had increased manifold for anything Palestine-related over the last several months. We planned to spread the word about the reading circle online (carefully). There existed a thin space where we could play with this. It had to be immediately obvious what this was about to those we wanted there, without tipping our hand in a way that was legible to those we didn\u2019t want there. We had to play in the space of symbols and icons. A poppy in the colours of the Palestinian flag. A watermelon against the background. A reading circle that was about \u201csolidarity\u201d, without explicit mention of any word or phrase that would tip off content moderators, cops, or right-wing troublemakers. A piece of digital ephemera that would expire after a period of time, and not subsist in perpetuity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>\u201cI guess with [platforms like] Instagram, it actually doubles your chances of being moderated in a particular way, because it&#8217;s image and text. So you have to be careful on both fronts of like, what will be seen as offensive or what will be seen as not meeting the guidelines. However, people are innately deeply creative when they want to share something. And, of course, again, that goes both ways in the good, bad, whatever. I think people have kind of learned that they have to be creative. And there&#8217;s a combination of creative and careful that is being played with, constantly both in words and in image, in order for content to be seen, important content to be seen, important content to reach the right people.
