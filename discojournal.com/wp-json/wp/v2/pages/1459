Thus, the digital and the analog are not simply reducible to sociological, anthropological, or even empirical observation. Rather, digitality and analogicity are free floating representational modes evident in many different formats and times, perhaps in all of them. Instead of a list of qualities, the digital is better defined as an event or operation.<\/em><sup>[1]<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By making this rudimentary sketch of DIGITAL-1 and DIGITAL-0, I hope to put two different digital dimensions of design into play, trifling with them to see how these shape us. As I have ordered these two states it may seem to imply that DIGITAL-0 precedes DIGITAL-1, inviting a further designation of the former as something more like \u2018analog\u2019 and the latter as a truer \u2018digital\u2019 topology. However, as Wark points out: \u201cThe terms analog and digital are invariably treated as if the relation between them was itself a digital one\u201d such that the digital makes the analog itself appear as something separate, turning a slippery difference into a clear distinction.<sup>[2]<\/sup> This usefully folds into a wider discussion of the representation, relation and structure of the analog and the digital detailed by fellow theorist Alexander Galloway, who reminds us that:\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201c\u2026digital and analog have a meaning in media and consumer electronics, but understood as synonyms for <em>discrete<\/em> and <em>continuous<\/em> they also pertain to long-standing philosophical discussions around similarity, identity, difference, and representation\u2026The digital is the capacity to divide things and make distinctions between them\u2026.The analog is the real with no abstraction, no reduction, no sampling or capture. \u201d<sup>[3]<\/sup><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To this end, by thinking of DIGITAL-0 and DIGITAL-1 together as an event or mode of operation rather than qualities like \u2018offline\u2019, \u2018old-school\u2019, \u2018real\u2019 or \u2018authentic\u2019, I would like to take a more of a scheming, ontological view of the digital as a design that works in and on the world in a related fashion. Instead of thinking about the forms generated by each digital system (clothing, devices, texts), let us consider what each of these different dimensions of the digital make or break. What forms of being occur in the slippage and play occurring between and betwixt -0 &amp; -1? Can we think through the phenomena of the digital from beyond a point of view framed by the user of digital things, and begin to look at digitality from the point of view of a weird, thing-like quality of \u2018<em>the digital<\/em>\u2019? For all its possibility and power what is the endgame of subjects locked inside digital gamespace? What kinds of designs does \u2018the digital\u2019 have on \u2018us\u2019?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this sense I would like to launch into a kind of speculative game that explores the possibility of the binary mode doing something to human being and becoming. By folding together the space of DIGITAL-0 and DIGITAL-1, can an ontologically significant and weird view of the digital emerge, and expand on the idea that \u201cthe past was significantly more digital than we give it credit for and that today\u2019s Digital Age, so-called, is better characterized through a series of analog concerns\u201d<sup>[4]<\/sup>? Galloway provides a useful observation when he states that \u201csimilar to the syllable or phoneme in structural linguistics, the zero and the one represented for Lacan a series of elementary blocks that could be arranged and rearranged in a semi-autonomous fashion, interfacing with consciousness but also somehow below and above it.\u201d<sup>[5]<\/sup> I would like to apply this idea to the possibility that both the over and under binary interlocking of weaving as a gestural interface and the constant digital interfacing with digital technologies might do something to consciousness on various levels.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, to get back to my questions about a design\/digital\/game that is somehow gaming us, I have found that in their expanded take on the digital either as critical method (Galloway) or topology (Wark) we can uncover some clues. Here, both recognise that within the digital there is something at play and at stake, making the digital a site of contemporary power, where capital exploits labor, and therefore the space of political confrontation and struggle. This points towards an absolute boundary where the domain of the digital is perfected, a space of purely relative and numerical value, and in turn, a locus for command and control of the analog remainder \u2014 which it treats as a mere residue. In this residue, Wark notes, \u201cthe digital might become again the threshold that turns a movement into a break, rather than imposing the break on movement\u201d, and a gamer as theorist might establish a transformation by shifting away from agon, distinction, decision and the fatal either\/or.\u00a0<sup>[6]<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would like to further invert this idea of analog residue and see if there might be a kind of digital shadow when viewed within \u201cparadigmatic analog modes\u201d of the mirror, the echo, the ghost, the trace, the outline.<sup>[7]<\/sup> I take these as useful modes of reading ahead and considering what, and how, the digital projects \u2014 thinking here in both a kind of cinematic mode of making visible by casting an image and a planned out mode of design \u2014\u00a0and thereby asking what will arrive as digital futures and defuturings.<sup>[8]<\/sup> All too often when we think about \u2018the future\u2019 it is assumed that technology will keep accelerating, an uninterrupted project, ever ongoing in a steady linear progression that keeps on making life better, smarter, sexier, savvier \u2014 an emerging DIGITAL-1,1. As it continues to expand into \u2018everywhere\u2019, how might we deterritorialise this digital topology and locate a space where a residue remains? We might need to consider the idea of digital residue in terms of its ever building ghost.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"ast-oembed-container \" style=\"height: 100%;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Computer predicts the end of civilisation (1973) | RetroFocus\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/cCxPOqwCr1I?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"ast-oembed-container \" style=\"height: 100%;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"NASA | Magnificent Eruption in Full HD\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/GrnGi-q6iWc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>What if all the lenses, platforms and devices that mediate our reality suddenly switched from \u2018ON\u2019 to a permanent \u2018OFF\u2019?

This includes situations where media are not only \u201cbroken,\u201d but are also working \u201ctoo well,\u201d such that \u201cmediation functions at a level beyond that of traditional forms of human mediation\u201d.<sup>[10]<\/sup> In a moment where all that was online goes offline, digital media and electronic devices could very well open up some strange forms of excommunication as dead media: objects no longer in use, but with some aspect of the object remaining active, perhaps almost haunted, or else remaining in use, but in a non- normative way.<sup>[11]<\/sup> In contrast to Thacker\u2019s examples, from magic lanterns to spirit photography, let\u2019s consider how the current utility and entanglement with our everyday lives could potentially induce similar situations of temporal disjunction \u2014 where objects either oscillate between being activated and inactivated (dead media), or objects become more than an object, endowed with almost divine (or divining) powers (haunted media) \u2014 but in reverse. Instead of objects becoming dead, haunted or weird, once freed from servicing these apparatus, could it be that the subject, or space, or even the real begin to operate as similar kinds of lacuna, opening up lost connections or rerouting attention to something cosmic, divine, supernatural or other phenomena that we once knew, but have since unknown?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"ast-oembed-container \" style=\"height: 100%;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Digital Rebel\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/uXngPHwzrcI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"ast-oembed-container \" style=\"height: 100%;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Daft Punk - Digital Love (Official Video)\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/FxzBvqY5PP0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>[end of Digital 0,1]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>REFERENCES<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><sup>[1]<\/sup> Galloway, Alexander R. 2022. \u201cGolden Age of Analog\u201d. <em>Critical Inquiry, volume 48, number 2<\/em> (Winter), 228. https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1086\/717324<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><sup>[2] <\/sup>Wark, 2007, 72.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><sup>[3] <\/sup>Galloway, 2022, 230.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><sup>[4] <\/sup>Galloway, 2022, 216.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><sup>[5]<\/sup> Ibid, 215.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><sup>[6] <\/sup>Wark, 2007, 72.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><sup>[7] <\/sup>Galloway notes that \u201cthe logic gate and the computer are merely the latest in a long stream of digital technologies that would begin with the integers, the alphabet, or even the atom, the synapse, the gene, and even the point itself\u201d, as such \u201cto think beyond consumer electronics liberates the analog \u2026\u00a0 duration, intensity, sensation, affect, as well as the wave, the gradient, and the curve\u2026 the analog is quite simply the interface of real difference\u2026 the real without any logic of presence or absence, the real without the principle of norm and deviation\u201d (Galloway, 2022, 229).
