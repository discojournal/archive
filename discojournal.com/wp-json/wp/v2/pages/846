Then, out of that explosion, Time, along with all things, came into existence. Time then wove itself through everything we do, make and think\u2014time of the cosmos, time of industry and recreation, time of biology and ecology.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We now find ourselves in an ever-interconnected world with complex cultures, technologies, rituals and thoughts. Our shared discoveries, failures, celebrations, conflicts and history coalesce into the present moment of overwhelming uncertainty, dotted with the incredible inventions, art and theories that make our continued struggle worth it. Shoutout to Time for making it all happen; we couldn\u2019t have existed without you.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Einstein famously said that time is relative, divorcing humanity from Time so that it may apply to the vast expanse of the Universe. As self-centred creatures with eyes only for ourselves, we look to other theorists who say that Time is subjective, that time relates specifically to the subject. Or in other words, that Time is <em>human<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From a postcolonial perspective, we understand time as both heterogeneous and conditional (Comaroff, 1985). As Achille Mbembe (2010) writes, \u201cFor many people caught in the vortex of colonialism and what comes after, the main indexes of time are the contingent, the ephemeral, the fugitive, and the fortuitous.\u201d Indeed, thanks to the accelerated nature of digital technologies and their historical roots in imperial violence, time is becoming less recognisable: 24\/7 service, ubiquitous availability and round-the-clock news lead to what cultural critic Jonathan Crary (2014) describes as, \u201ca time without sequence or recurrence\u2026a hallucination of presence, of an unalterable permanence composed of incessant, frictionless operations.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we were rocks, or trees, or planets, then we might have said that Time is rocks, trees, or planets. Alas, with our limited embodiment of the human, our proclamation stands. As humans, we&#8217;ve evolved beyond mere regard for our immediate environment to be able to tap into folds of memories or contemplate future eventualities. In our human existence, our need for connection has also led to the elaborate constructions of digital infrastructure that allow us to communicate across vast distances and disjointed time, and for you to be reading this now. What strange circumstances we find ourselves in, that Time begets our ability to transcend time, at a juncture where the ubiquity of digital technologies is irrefutable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is here that we unearth the theme of DiSCo Journal Issue 1: the digital\u2019s phenomenological<em> annihilation of time<\/em>. \u201cAnnihilation\u201d may conjure pictures of violence and destruction, but we also recognise its potential for renewal. In addition to exploring the time that is decimated by the digital, we also advocate for a digital time, with its humanistic elements, that can be moulded to create novelty and value. Counter to the slow cancellation of the future (re: Franco \u201cBifo\u201d Berardi and Mark Fisher), we ask, can digital time help reconnect and resubscribe?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-4 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:100%\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-3 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-2 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-1 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/discojournal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/7LQU-5.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1683\" width=\"115\" height=\"122\"\/><figcaption><em>loading&#8230;<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/discojournal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/7LQU-6.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1684\" width=\"116\" height=\"122\"\/><figcaption><em>issue 1&#8230;<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/discojournal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/7LQU-7.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1685\" width=\"116\" height=\"122\"\/><figcaption><em>pls wait&#8230;<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>In the inaugural issue, the editorial committee* selected eleven submissions that fall into three classic temporalities: the past, the present and the future. Through these designations, the issue demonstrates the wide range of topics, disciplines and forms that are preoccupied with digital time and its phenomenological reception. Moreover, it shows how these traditional temporalities of time are unfixed, wavering, and prone to transformation in the face of breakneck digitalisation.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:15px\">First is \u23f3Odes to the Past\u23f3, which contemplates the digital\u2019s influence on historical memory and inchoate relationships.

Rather, our intention is to problematise and perhaps clarify our understanding of time in the digital age.
