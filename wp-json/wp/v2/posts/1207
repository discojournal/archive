As a means to further explore this change, I offer Nicky Broekhuysen\u2019s exhibition <em>The Digital Archeologist<\/em>, as a pathway to guide us as we meander through these far corners of the digital realm in our search for understanding.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:15px\">I wrote this text <a href=\"https:\/\/files.artbutler.com\/file\/1172\/45bd3489b1334f1b.pdf\">Dig Deep<\/a><sup>[3]<\/sup> in 2016, three years after the Gezi Movement in Turkey, where due to the political situation, digital spaces became safer places to gather yet still we tried to hold on to the physical as long as it was due. Since then, many things have changed in my hometown Istanbul where various [art] spaces have closed and been forced to move or transform themselves\u2014a familiar phenomenon currently occurring in London, my new hometown, thanks to state-led gentrification, the financial crisis and other inhumane policies put forth by the current Tory Government.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:15px\">What is our responsibility with these memories, then, these artefacts? Just because you remember them, will you be able to hold them when the time comes or when they are urgently needed? Or should they perish into the [in]visible archives of the digital? Does the past become present when you recall them? Who has the keys to the ongoing archiving of the internet lockers? Mckenzie Wark rightfully and beautifully suggests that \u201cwe need another worldview, one drawn out of what is left of the actually collaborative and collective and common practices via which the world is actually built and run, a worldview of solidarity and the gift. A worldview that works as a low theory extracted from worker and hacker practices, rather than a high theory trying to legislate about them from above.\u201d<sup>[4]<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:15px\">Sustainability works differently regarding individual memories and storytelling, yet websites need budgets for eternal open-sourcing. We all do have our open and private libraries of knowledge productivity in the arts, yet when shared in social media, newsletters, forums or even diaries, one can lose their way in the maze even with the help of keywords. The Matrix is expanding, and binary codes are now similar to recipes; all we need to do is to cook with the taste of our own hands.<sup>[5]<\/sup> Therefore experimentation, i\u015f birli\u011fi<sup>[6]<\/sup>, <em>collective-collaborative<\/em> practices and repetitive acts of making kins are essential for our times to bound the time with the work and resist the destruction of our worlds in the making.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"889\" src=\"http:\/\/discojournal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/nicky_poetry-1024x889.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1373\" style=\"width:646px;height:561px\" srcset=\"https:\/\/discojournal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/nicky_poetry-1024x889.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/discojournal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/nicky_poetry-300x260.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/discojournal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/nicky_poetry-768x667.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/discojournal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/nicky_poetry-1536x1334.jpeg 1536w, https:\/\/discojournal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/nicky_poetry-24x21.jpeg 24w, https:\/\/discojournal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/nicky_poetry-36x31.jpeg 36w, https:\/\/discojournal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/nicky_poetry-48x42.jpeg 48w, https:\/\/discojournal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/nicky_poetry.jpeg 1548w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-4 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignright size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"200\" height=\"148\" src=\"http:\/\/discojournal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/200w.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1490\"\/><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"200\" height=\"148\" src=\"http:\/\/discojournal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/200w.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1490\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>interlude<\/em>&#8230;<em>red or blue?<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"200\" height=\"148\" src=\"http:\/\/discojournal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/200w.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1490\"\/><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How our paths were crossed with Nicky Broekhuysen<\/strong><br>a short story within a story<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:15px\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.blokartspace.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">BLOK art space<\/a>, where I first worked with Nicky, has been closed since I moved to London, right before the pandemic started in the winter of 2019. The Bumiller Collection\u2019s studio, which generously hosted <em>The Digital Archeologist<\/em>, has also since closed its doors to contemporary interventions instead of continuing as a nomadic space. So we follow a phantom of stamps that echoed inside the walls of an Islamic Art Collection\u2019s project space that no longer exists. When I think about apparitions and recalling archives, I always find myself thinking about artist Patrick Staff\u2019s work, <em>The Foundation<sup>[7]<\/sup>, <\/em>which takes place around the iconic Tom of Finland Foundation in Los Angeles, an archive dedicated to protect erotic arts. Even though the preserved art and works are different, the methodology of Staff\u2019s response to this archive as building relations and stories between objects, artworks and the foundation\u2019s space rather than categorising them is quite spellbinding, a term I frequently use to describe Nicky\u2019s practice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"http:\/\/discojournal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/figure-II--768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1374\" style=\"width:384px;height:512px\" srcset=\"https:\/\/discojournal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/figure-II--768x1024.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/discojournal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/figure-II--225x300.jpeg 225w, https:\/\/discojournal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/figure-II--1152x1536.jpeg 1152w, https:\/\/discojournal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/figure-II--1536x2048.jpeg 1536w, https:\/\/discojournal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/figure-II--18x24.jpeg 18w, https:\/\/discojournal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/figure-II--27x36.jpeg 27w, https:\/\/discojournal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/figure-II--36x48.jpeg 36w, https:\/\/discojournal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/figure-II--scaled.jpeg 1920w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Figure 2<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:15px\">It was a vociferous Istanbul afternoon when I met Nicky; we found our peaceful moment in an antique shop next to BLOK art space, where we would work together in the following days. Nicky had a Turkish coffee; I made a silly joke to break my social anxiety by offering to read her future [reading one&#8217;s future from the coffee cup is a way of saying for future-telling]; Nicky accepted it gracefully as she is always ready for a midday seance. She closed her cup, turned it upside down, and handed it over. I put a cold 1 Turkish lira on it and waited for a while; we talked about our passions, families, and many others. Time passed impatiently; I opened the cup and immediately realised it was not just another exhibition experience with a temporary companion. Nicky was quite special, and so was her cup, showing me a giant &#8216;0&#8217; next to &#8216;1&#8217;. Such a poetic way of starting a journey with a magical artist like Nicky, who works with binary codes, intuition and repetition as methodologies that create magic when combined. I smiled and laughed for the entire day as the proper grinagog of the project space I was working at the time couldn&#8217;t handle the flow of emotions I was receiving through Nicky&#8217;s presence.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns poesia is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-5 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:100%\">\n<p><em>I always think Nicky works with time<br>repetition, decisions on how to continue<br>complete<br>rather than what she uses, rather than the binary<br>0&#8217;s 1&#8217;s are not only binary code; they are Nicky&#8217;s language, shapes, tools,<br>addressing the potential rather than the limitation<br>now they are colourful<br>they bloom in spring<br>we had explosions of them in Istanbul on the walls of the gallery we worked side by side<br>and the drifting sound waves floating in the digital sphere<sup>[8]<\/sup><br>the fact that nothing in life can remain static, she says<br>for transitioning, for in constant fluid being<br>they choose to become something else other than what they are already named, constructed<\/em><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-6 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"786\" height=\"1024\" src=\"http:\/\/discojournal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/The-Digital-Archaeologist-VI-786x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1375\" srcset=\"https:\/\/discojournal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/The-Digital-Archaeologist-VI-786x1024.jpg 786w, https:\/\/discojournal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/The-Digital-Archaeologist-VI-230x300.jpg 230w, https:\/\/discojournal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/The-Digital-Archaeologist-VI-768x1000.jpg 768w, https:\/\/discojournal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/The-Digital-Archaeologist-VI-1180x1536.jpg 1180w, https:\/\/discojournal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/The-Digital-Archaeologist-VI-1573x2048.jpg 1573w, https:\/\/discojournal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/The-Digital-Archaeologist-VI-18x24.jpg 18w, https:\/\/discojournal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/The-Digital-Archaeologist-VI-28x36.jpg 28w, https:\/\/discojournal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/The-Digital-Archaeologist-VI-37x48.jpg 37w, https:\/\/discojournal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/The-Digital-Archaeologist-VI-scaled.jpg 1966w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 786px) 100vw, 786px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Figure 3<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"793\" height=\"1024\" src=\"http:\/\/discojournal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/The-Digital-Archaeologist-V-793x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1376\" style=\"width:793px;height:1024px\" srcset=\"https:\/\/discojournal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/The-Digital-Archaeologist-V-793x1024.jpg 793w, https:\/\/discojournal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/The-Digital-Archaeologist-V-232x300.jpg 232w, https:\/\/discojournal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/The-Digital-Archaeologist-V-768x991.jpg 768w, https:\/\/discojournal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/The-Digital-Archaeologist-V-1190x1536.jpg 1190w, https:\/\/discojournal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/The-Digital-Archaeologist-V-1587x2048.jpg 1587w, https:\/\/discojournal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/The-Digital-Archaeologist-V-19x24.jpg 19w, https:\/\/discojournal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/The-Digital-Archaeologist-V-28x36.jpg 28w, https:\/\/discojournal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/The-Digital-Archaeologist-V-37x48.jpg 37w, https:\/\/discojournal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/The-Digital-Archaeologist-V-scaled.jpg 1983w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 793px) 100vw, 793px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Figure 4<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:15px\">Every year following the summer of 2013 was getting stranger and weirder for Istanbul; I was already convinced that Nicky and I were meant to know each other beyond time and space. Our journey was not for or about us, but for both of us to have the courage to face and to reveal something immense that you would rather prefer to have company while it unfolds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:15px\">When we make exhibitions, we respond to certain things, experiment and create spaces and stories, but these come to life through various spatial, emotional, and temporal relations. I have recently grown more tempted and interested in these relationships, more so than even at the beginning of my [art] journey. It took us a couple of years to become close friends. After Istanbul, Nicky invited me to her Berlin exhibition at <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.the-bumiller-collection.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">the Bumiller Collection<\/a> and to write about her work and practice for the exhibition catalogue as well as to moderate the artist&#8217;s talk alongside the exhibition&#8217;s programme.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"ast-oembed-container \" style=\"height: 100%;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The Stonebreakers\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/180146734?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Video 1<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:15px\">Later on, we had our first lengthy dinner in Berlin and talked about parallel universes, our family secrets and how our generation should be more caring and giving, especially while working together and collaborating when it comes to queer loving. Then we published an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.artfridge.de\/2018\/10\/interview-nicky-broekhuysen-mk.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">interview<\/a><sup>[9]<\/sup> where Nicky shared the details of her relationship with her grandmother and her life generously; later on, we decided to call each other and have the same <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9wbXkwdZrTI&amp;ab_channel=CCSTATIONICOLLECTIVECUKURCUMA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">conversation<\/a><sup>[10]<\/sup> in a podcast format. It was during the first lockdown, and we never felt closer. It was not the physical boundaries that kept us apart; the limitations of our stories were seeking expansion, fluidity and more space. And we decided to let them have their contagion.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote has-ast-global-color-6-color has-text-color\" style=\"font-size:17px\"><blockquote><p>All memories are like the bog that fills the hollows of the cemetery, or the cold, muddy waters of ruins. The totality of the memories of the world can ignore destruction, but we have only a fragmentary grasp of the memories of the world. All that remains are moments and incidents. <em>&nbsp; <\/em>&nbsp;<\/p><cite>Marcel Proust, <em>Remembrance of Things Past<\/em><sup>[11]<\/sup><\/cite><\/blockquote><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\" style=\"font-size:15px\">The Bumiller Collection held a contemporary intervention exhibition twice a year and invited an artist to exhibit their work alongside the collection, creating new understandings and relations between the works, artefacts, objects and their time. Using binary code as \u2018her artistic language\u2019 Nicky created these incredible messages that calmly ask roaring questions about language to the collection objects, the space, and the exhibition visitors. There was only one screen placed in the exhibition space that shows the video work of Nicky Broekhuysen (see video II) &#8211; &#8216;inserting the digital space into the physical room as part of the exhibition&#8217;s exploration of media archaeology.&#8217; The rest of the works played their parts in fracturing our understanding of time by inviting all to meditate in front of this new language that we usually take for granted as machines and computer systems read before and for us. I never thought that binary code belonged to the machines; it is the universal code of a rudimentary understanding of time and system makings. Taking the codes out of their current use and representation and creating lustful, physically-driven languages out of them is very queering and alluring to our already complex relationship with the digital, which can still be distancing for many due to lack of sweat and spit. The objects exhibited from the Bumiller Collection were related to the early times of writing,&nbsp; tools of writing, manuscripts, and experimentations which were uniquely loose, open to change and to flux yet remain well-preserved in the passing of time. Inspired, Nicky recalled this freedom by reconstructing some of those methodologies yet maintaining supreme craftsmanship and experimentation. I believe the paper will hold the ink as long as it can and we will trust the printed materials as the continuation of the digital realms, which might give us new ways of looking at digital archives and their sustainability.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo aligncenter wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"ast-oembed-container \" style=\"height: 100%;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The Digital Archaeologist Video.mp4\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/735752510?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay;

At the age of 13, her family moved to New Zealand where she completed her studies. After graduating with a Bachelor of Fine Arts Degree from Auckland University, she moved to Shanghai, China, in 2006. It was in Shanghai that she first began working with binary numbers 1 and 0. In 2008 Broekhuysen moved to Berlin, Germany where she continued to develop her language of binary code, exhibiting both in Berlin and internationally for the following 11 years. Recently, in 2019 she relocated her studio to The Pyrenees in France to be closer to nature and where she continues to create and exhibit. Broekhuysen is represented by Davidson Gallery in New York.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/minekaplangi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Mine Kaplangi<\/strong><\/a> (they\/them, 1987, Istanbul) is an independent curator and art mediator based in London.
