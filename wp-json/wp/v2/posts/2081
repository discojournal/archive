An underpinning rationale, as well as a clear definition, continue to be negotiated in various web blogs, forums and online groups. As Peter Schwenger writes in the first published book on the historical, critical and contemporary contexts of asemic writing, the term asemic writing has not led to \u2018a general consensus, an artistic practice governed by conventions\u2019.<sup data-fn=\"644cd391-d01c-4501-8517-7638f04a1242\" class=\"fn\"><a href=\"#644cd391-d01c-4501-8517-7638f04a1242\" id=\"644cd391-d01c-4501-8517-7638f04a1242-link\">2<\/a><\/sup> The American writer and artist Michael Jacobson, who publishes asemic writing through the website <em>The New Post-Literate<\/em> and his <em>Post-Asemic Press,<\/em> states: \u2018Sometimes it seems so large that there is no one clear definition of what asemic writing is or will become.\u2019<sup data-fn=\"7d8ca4f0-3daa-41db-80ff-faa81825ef95\" class=\"fn\"><a href=\"#7d8ca4f0-3daa-41db-80ff-faa81825ef95\" id=\"7d8ca4f0-3daa-41db-80ff-faa81825ef95-link\">3<\/a><\/sup><sup> <\/sup>The abstract nature of asemic writing defies both theoretical consideration and academic attention.

Reason enough, one might argue, not to complicate matters by bringing them together. At the same time, the research for this paper revealed an exuberant amount of parallels in the discourse around hacking and the discussions around asemic writing, almost as if they were talking about the same subject. This paper takes this observation quite literally, using references from one discipline to write about the other, to see what else might emerge from such an encounter.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hacking writing,<br>Writing hacking,<br>Hacked writing,<br>Written hack,<br>Hacking in writing,<br>Writing into hacking,&nbsp;<br>A writing hack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This paper hacks writing. It is not just writing about the practice of asemic writing as a practice that hacks the formal and structural elements of writing, as explained in the introductory section of this paper. The act of writing this paper is itself subject to the practice of hacking, exploring the concept of hacking through the choices of structure and writing style. The paper therefore explores the relationship between hacking and writing, and writing and hacking in its various forms. Any confusion is intended and welcome.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the context of this paper, references are taken out of their original context and used to describe a different context in order to open up new conversations and explorations in a creative alliance across disciplines. The aim is to extend and deviate from what has already been written, \u2018[hacking\/writing] the new out of the old\u2019.<sup data-fn=\"5dd4cc19-1383-46b1-88a8-4540ea63cfa4\" class=\"fn\"><a href=\"#5dd4cc19-1383-46b1-88a8-4540ea63cfa4\" id=\"5dd4cc19-1383-46b1-88a8-4540ea63cfa4-link\">8<\/a><\/sup> As exemplified in the previous quotation, the altered quotations retain their original wording and structure. The words written in square brackets replace or add to the author\u2019s original words, transforming the quote to talk about the same idea, but in the context of a different subject area. They appropriate the quote to intersect with, but depart from, its original context. The \u2018\/\u2018 makes a sentence hover between the contexts of asemic writing and hacking, confusing both and prioritising neither \u2014 the order of the words is random to avoid direct identification of the original context. Due to the borderline academic nature of this method, endnotes are used to ensure academic integrity, traceability and transparency to the original source.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This creative method of \u2018hacking writing\u2019 is not intended to misrepresent the thoughts, ideas and work of the original author, nor to devalue or disrespect their words. Rather, it seeks to use their words as a starting point for making interdisciplinary connections that might lead to new interpretations and discussions beyond the original context. Hacking writing becomes a process of writing writing out its repetitive cycles of citation and recitation. Feminist media scholars Bassett, Kemper and O&#8217;Riordan, for example, in their book <em>Furious,<\/em> justify their \u2018unforgivable [\u2026] lack of full citations\u2019 by refusing to maintain the \u2018citation circularity, which finds itself trapped in ever smaller circles, an echo chamber that does not break out\u2019.<sup data-fn=\"f96543b6-251d-4307-a6c0-f442b59ff79d\" class=\"fn\"><a href=\"#f96543b6-251d-4307-a6c0-f442b59ff79d\" id=\"f96543b6-251d-4307-a6c0-f442b59ff79d-link\">9<\/a><\/sup> They argue for \u2018the need for new forms of scholarly writing\u2019, in which writing becomes a \u2018process of experimenting and opening\u2019.<sup data-fn=\"f7fb5ca7-535e-45f5-b2b9-917b192cbaf2\" class=\"fn\"><a href=\"#f7fb5ca7-535e-45f5-b2b9-917b192cbaf2\" id=\"f7fb5ca7-535e-45f5-b2b9-917b192cbaf2-link\">10<\/a><\/sup> In hacking writing, writing is not a reproduction of what is already known, but a creative process that produces difference: \u2018New [hacks\/writing] supersede old [writing\/hacks] [\u2026].

The term asemic writing refers to nothing other than itself. Unlike traditional writing, whose appearance is defined and constrained by the somewhat flexible but limited forms of its respective writing system, asemic writing has no predetermined or preconceived form. Its appearance is defined by a movement of challenge, of resistance to the known and the prescribed. However, asemic writing is not a mere rejection or negation of writing; it retains a reference to its opposite. The formal diversity of asemic writing emerges from an active engagement with the tension between the constraining properties of writing\u2019s convention and gestural expression beyond routines, habits and systems. The gestures and awareness of the act of writing and reading are countered by a determined resistance to giving in to conditioned patterns of movement and thought. It is a deliberate departure, but not a complete dissociation from conventional writing. It does not seek to separate writing from writing, or reading from reading. Rather, asemic writing leads to more intense forms of writing and reading through active participation in an act that is usually disguised by habit. As Schwenger writes: \u2019It extends beyond what can be read or understood according to the logic of any signifying system.\u2019<sup data-fn=\"10d2f5c5-11ae-48d6-95fc-046e155219ce\" class=\"fn\"><a href=\"#10d2f5c5-11ae-48d6-95fc-046e155219ce\" id=\"10d2f5c5-11ae-48d6-95fc-046e155219ce-link\">12<\/a><\/sup>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wark describes the complications of describing hackers as a class while remaining true to the abstract and unstable nature of the practice.

Rather, it is a term that encourages the creation of new practices and discourses; That transcends boundaries rather than erecting them. It is a practice that is defined by a conscious act of troubling and transforming the existing, redirecting it towards the new and different.
