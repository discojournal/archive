Due to various historical factors, alongside the economic and spatio-temporal convenience of new technologies, this encounter is increasingly influencing underground music communities worldwide. However, there is an ingrained proclivity to declare underground music dead in the digital age.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:15px\">For example, a 2021 social media post discussing the underground in Berlin, wrote:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:15px\"><em>\u201cIf it&#8217;s on Facebook, it&#8217;s not underground at all\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:15px\">Conversely, many of my social media feeds on Facebook, Reddit and Instagram feature Internet-influenced underground musical subcultures, and as scene insiders<sup>[1]<\/sup>, we present a mixtape of underground music collectives representative of these occurrences accompanied by this explicative text. While not exhaustive, the contribution is a multi-media commentary on the digital development of transnationally connected subcultural movements and maps the spatial and temporal boundaries of a specific network of artists grounded on artistic, conceptual and political affinity. As a consequence of the progressive disappearance of performative spaces and the multiplication of niche &#8216;no-audience underground&#8217; subgenres\u2014music movements in which authors and fandom collide (Hayler 2015) \u2014artists have moved online experimenting with the DIY possibilities offered by the net and its &#8216;digital folklore&#8217; (de Seta 2019). Through production and dissemination tools, musicians have gained renewed access to subcultural capital and artistic exchange, collapsing geographical distances and the shortage of economic and social resources, while adapting to maintain the ethos of underground practices.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:15px\">In order to characterise and analyse what we term the \u2018digital underground\u2019, we explore the argument in three sections, building on our personal experiences alongside data gathered from artists\u2019 descriptions. In the first part of this article we illustrate how the meta-genre has formed, then we illustrate how this subculture experiments in their productions with alternative temporalities and, finally, we hypothesise some of the genre&#8217;s key-features, expanding on themes discussed in the first two sections. On the one hand, we postulate that the musicians defining this new digital underground respect the fundamental traits of the \u2018original\u2019 genre; that is, under-the-radar projects pursuing aesthetic radicalism and a \u2018Do It Yourself\u2019 ethos, intentionally placing themselves at the margins of the music industry.<sup>[2]<\/sup> On the other, we argue that for some of these artists the Internet is not only an instrument of music dissemination, but a creative device. Through its audio-visual tools, a new, digital underground represented by entities like <a href=\"http:\/\/quantumnatives.com\/\"><em>Quantum Natives<\/em><\/a><em><sup> <\/sup><\/em><sup>[3]<\/sup>(<em>44:25 \u2013 46:45<\/em>) can only thrive online as it becomes a lens to express and reinterpret conceptions of time and space, often with synesthetic connotations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Death to the underground: is it still a thing?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:15px\">In 2014,<strong> <\/strong><em>The Wire<\/em> published an article titled \u2018<em>Subterranean Homesick Blues<\/em>\u2018<sup>[4]<\/sup>, where David Keenan, author and key figure of the U.S. and UK underground<sup>[5]<\/sup>, stated that after more than forty years, the pseudo-movement incarnated by the post-1960 cultural expansion of bands such as The Velvet Underground and Captain Beefheart<sup>[6] <\/sup>wasn\u2019t a symbol of \u2018Do It Yourself\u2019 attitude and countercultural isolationism anymore; the defining elements of the subculture. Instead, <em>it had become a genre<\/em>, a gimmick ready to be emulated.<sup>[7] <\/sup>Ultimately, an issue of <em>attitude<\/em> had become an issue of <em>style<\/em>, thus compromising the subculture\u2019s integrity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:15px\">Following Frank Zappa\u2019s principle<sup>[8]<\/sup> that, \u201cthe mainstream comes to you, but you have to go to the underground\u201d, journalists and cultural theorists such as Simon Reynolds observed that the Web has extinguished the idea of an obscure \u201ctrue underground\u201d, being now too easy for anyone to discover anything.<sup>[9]<\/sup> Nonetheless, Reynolds stated that the \u2018new underground scenes\u2019 differ from the \u2018originals\u2019 in two senses<sup>[10]<\/sup>: first, as a constellation of online microgenres spanning from Soundcloud rap to vaporwave<sup>[11]<\/sup> and, second, as musical subgenres where authors and fandom coincide; a <a href=\"https:\/\/radiofreemidwich.wordpress.com\/2015\/06\/14\/what-i-mean-by-the-term-no-audience-underground-2015-remix\/\"><em>no-audience underground<\/em><\/a>.<sup>[12]<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:15px\">The digital transformation of music is imputable to the democratisation<sup>[13]<\/sup> and hijacking<sup>[14]<\/sup> of mass-distributed, affordable consumer\u2014from cables and smartphones, to headphones to audio-monitors\u2014alongside the Web\u2019s creative and circulatory affordances provided by the internet.<sup>[15] <\/sup>Free, cheap or illegally downloaded music apps and Virtual Studio Technologies (VSTs) such as like Borderlands, VCV Rack, Supercollider, Pure Data or Serum as well as digital audio workstations and editors such as GarageBand, Ableton, Logic Pro, Pro Tools, FL Studio or Audacity, nudged amateurs and underground musicians to employ semi-professional and professional music production tools constituting valid alternatives to otherwise expensive, cumbersome, and esoteric technologies.<sup>[16]<\/sup> Moreover, free streaming websites like Bandcamp and Soundcloud, along with non-musical, digital platforms such as Linktree, YouTube, Discord, WordPress and social networks, namely Instagram, Tik Tok and Facebook, provided musicians with virtual stages to not only promote and sell their productions more or less directly to the public, but also to discover, exchange and collaborate with kindred artists transnationally. With tools allowing them to record complex musical works and digital services substituting classic, physical trading circuits and mailorders between artists, distributions and labels, musicians are ultimately crafting their sounds in new economically and logistically convenient ways, building scenes in the meantime; all without necessarily leaving their bedrooms.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:15px\">The general preference of many underground musicians to favour these new media and technologies is instigated by hostile cultural and urban policies making it increasingly difficult for artists to access spaces in real life (IRL). The dramatic and ongoing rise of rents in city centres following the global real estate crisis<sup>[17]<\/sup>, the continuous decline of independent clubs\u2019 and live venues\u2019 revenues<sup>[18]<\/sup>, the closing down and criminalisation of many autonomous zones and squats<sup>[19]<\/sup>, the drastic cuts to arts and culture fundings<sup>[20]<\/sup>, as well as the downfall of music sales and the rise of the streaming industry,<sup>[21]<\/sup> have forced experimental musicians to resort to marginal territories such as garages, flats, bookshops and art galleries, because normal venues for live shows are increasingly unsuitable and hostile.<sup>[22]<\/sup> Thus, the <em>no-audience underground<\/em> also becomes a <a href=\"https:\/\/soundmattersthesemblog.wordpress.com\/2016\/12\/19\/gabriele-de-seta-the-no-venue-underground-sounding-hong-kongs-lack-of-performance-spaces\/\"><em>no-venue underground<\/em><\/a>,<sup>[23]<\/sup> and is compelled to follow Gavin Prior\u2019s coniage: &#8216;<em>to hell or to Internet<\/em>&#8216;<sup>[24]<\/sup>; when the lack of offline resources makes the sustenance of underground musical cultures impossible, the internet&#8217;s applicative, promotional, and communicative potential proves the only alternative capable of nurturing small, connected international scenes. In short, to compensate for the disappearance of localised, physical space, musicians resort to virtual, decentralised environments.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:15px\">Contrary to the popular opinion that the underground is a set of independent, radical aesthetic practices incompatible with the internet, contemporary musicians have employed the digital infrastructure to expand on the metagenre\u2019s credo and creative possibilities<sup>[25]<\/sup>, connecting with scattered fellow artists and forging transnational ties. But how does this new pseudo-movement differ from its original IRL counterpart?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Sounds from the modem&#8217;s peripheries: temporalities in the new digital underground<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:15px\">In order to highlight the peculiarities of the scene, it is worth trying to grasp its speculative boundaries first. From this perspective, one of the entities that most represents the digital underground is <em>modem<\/em>, based in Ljubljana, Slovenia, they are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/modemodemodem\/about\/?ref=page_internal\">described by its founder<\/a><sup>[26]<\/sup> as a student radio show, \u201cuncovering the hidden sounds from the online underground [&#8230;]\u201d. While not exhaustive, the broadcast charts the development of these decentralised subcultural movements.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:15px\">Employing imagery and other technical improvisations, many of the projects showcased by <em>modem<\/em> fit the ethos of digital folklore; that is, \u201ca vernacular emerging from below and a folk art created by users for users, coalescing into repertoires of jokes, memes, and other genres of digital content\u201d.<sup>[27]<\/sup> Projects customarily resort to vernacular, pirate techniques such as sampling Internet content or employing free or illegally downloaded music apps and softwares. These musicians also propose readings of folklore through digital means, superimposing mythical registers and historical symbologies with the secularity and pop appeal of technological devices, memes and video games.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:15px\">Interestingly, many of these artists strongly engage with ideas of alternative, non-linear time and space. For example, Rainbow Island\u2019s album <a href=\"https:\/\/artetetra.bandcamp.com\/album\/illmatrix\">ILLMATRIX<\/a><sup> [28]<\/sup>(<em>46:30 \u2013 54:10<\/em>) dabbles with time\u2019s physical alteration by affiliating themselves to the symbol \u2018GMT\u00b1\u221e\u2019: an uncharted temporality that defines the digital timezone of the band\u2019s \u201cinternet diaspora\u201d.<sup>[29]<\/sup> <a href=\"https:\/\/francescaheart.bandcamp.com\/album\/eurybia?from=search&amp;search_item_id=1963587619&amp;search_item_type=a&amp;search_match_part=%3F&amp;search_page_id=2104450193&amp;search_page_no=1&amp;search_rank=2&amp;search_sig=bbeeef70edaefb8d9402d17e73018c7d\">Francesca Heart<\/a>\u2019s<sup>[30]<\/sup> album Eurybia (<em>16:15 \u2013 20:58<\/em>) explores a superimposition of different ages, where images of nymphs and mythological landscapes are connected with new age music and contemporary video game soundtracks and ringtones.<sup>[31] <\/sup>Through these artists, time is both perceived and expressed as tangled and multilayered, as opposed to linear, progressive and irreversible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:15px\">In addition, one of the albums which best embodies the collision between underground music practices, digital folklore and alternative, digital temporalities is <a href=\"https:\/\/artetetra.bandcamp.com\/album\/nott-longa-ost\">Mondoriviera<\/a>\u2019s<sup>[32]<\/sup> soundtrack to video game N\u00f2tt L\u00f6nga (<em>33:04 \u2013 37:07<\/em>), described as the music to \u201can abandoned retro game haunted by folk horror creatures and ghosts of broken futures. [\u2026] a liminal dimension where time has lost all meaning [&#8230;]. Past and future, reality and dreams, nostalgia and amnesia have merged beyond repair.\u201d Likely unknown to many, this follows the temporal tropes familiar to gaming, where&nbsp; multiple temporal frames<sup>[33]<\/sup>, time compression and de-sequencing<sup>[34]<\/sup> are employed to execute a regional narrative to conjure a suspended time-space; a new liminal dimension.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:15px\">As projects like Mondoriviera show, these temporalities also bear synaesthetic qualities. Superimposing timelines frequently implies overlapping spaces, planes, dimensions and vice-versa, in a way that reminds of Leopardi\u2019s \u2018vague\u2019, where concepts like &#8216;far&#8217; and &#8216;ancient&#8217; are lost in space-time extension and consequently their meaning cannot be fully grasped.<sup>[35]<\/sup> In this sense, as Enrico Monacelli has pointed out in his essay-review of Loris Cericola&#8217;s album \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/artetetra.bandcamp.com\/album\/metaphysical-graffiti\">Metaphysical Graffiti<\/a>\u201d<sup>[36]<\/sup> (<em>43:00 \u2013 44:48<\/em>), although these works flirt with nostalgia, the digital world and the screen are for the most part conceived as portals, gateways to personal, sonic imagery. A compendiary definition comes from one-man project <a href=\"https:\/\/polonius1.bandcamp.com\/music\">Polonius<\/a>\u2019 (<em>36:48 \u2013 43:00<\/em>) whom advertises their wares on bandcamp as, \u201csciencefiction archeomiragical time travel tapes\u201d<sup>[37]<\/sup>; an expression where history, imagination and different temporalities are mutually involved in a work of vague, sonic world-building.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:15px\">The fascination for alternative temporalities and the digital is not exclusive to this subculture and has been recently picked up by artists defined as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.prismomag.com\/appunti-per-una-discografia-accelerazionista\/\">accelerationist pop<\/a><sup>[38]<\/sup> or <a href=\"https:\/\/pitchfork.com\/features\/article\/2010s-rise-of-conceptronica-electronic-music\/\">conceptronica<\/a><sup>[39]<\/sup>; the latter defined as conceptual electronica and most likely to be found in a museum than a nightclub. The peculiarity, then, is not that artists have imagined alternative geographies and timelines, but that they have done so as often self-taught, DIY amateurs resorting to vernacular practices and easily-accessible digital technologies. Their works are not ordered critiques of capitalism or conceptual pieces designed for gallery exhibitions. Rather, they are naive, ambiguous and lighthearted pastiches of mismatched audio-video influences reminiscent of the Web\u2019s compulsory hyperlink structure driven by escapism and curiosity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Conclusions<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:15px\">By analysing different positions regarding the underground\u2019s contemporary evolution and examining ethnographic data (i.e. liner notes, descriptions), I have tried to show how bands and projects belonging to the digital underground have come to exploit the Internet as a field of possibilities for vernacular, creative action as well as a tool revitalising the democratic ideology of the subculture, largely expressed through and inspired by digital means. Additionally, I have framed this developing scene through some of its key features. In sum, participants to the digital underground (1) perceive complex, synaesthetic temporalities attributable to digital media&#8217;s structure, (2) express them though the digital-folklore-vernacular, (3) create gateways to personal, DIY world-building processes and (4) explore naive and lighthearted pastiches of audiovisual references and influences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>[end]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>BIO<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Luigi Monteanni <\/strong>is a PhD candidate in music studies at SOAS under the AHRC CHASE.
