<p>“It was a cliche thought, but Maria had always sympathised with the monster.” This throwaway line from Imogen Binnie’s <em>Nevada </em>(2013, p.22) is an echo of a common thread of trans thinking that can be identified everywhere from Susan Stryker’s seminal 1994 text on <em>Frankenstein</em>, to Preciado’s <em>Can the Monster Speak? </em>(2019). The relationship between monsters and trans bodies can even be encountered in art by cis creators, as exemplified in the many films by David Cronenberg. The similar trope of monster as outsider has existed in the DNA of popular media since Shelly’s <em>Frankenstein: Or, Modern Prometheus</em> (1818), and James Whale’s cinematic adaptation from 1931. Frankenstein’s Monster is also a glitch, something that exists beyond the confines of the world as normally understood; they’re uncanny, uncertain, a body that exists on the fringe. When Dr. Frankenstein has Igor flick the switch and, in a bolt of lightning his creation is (re)born, that same creation is also glitching out, finding a way to exist beyond and between the boundaries of the real world. </p>



<p>The first glitch that I remember was from playing the PS2 game <em>The Simpsons Hit and Run</em> (2003). I remember driving Professor Frink’s rocket car and falling off of the edge of Springfield, somehow ending up beneath the map itself. I twisted the camera to look up at the town while I existed outside of it, a moment of slippage. I remember finding it strange, uncanny, but still somehow tempting. I kept looking for ways to fall off the edge of the map.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In <em>Glitch Feminism: A Manifesto </em>(2020), Legacy Russell argues that the binary body itself exists as a way to limit us, and that the idea of the glitch instead allows us to “consider the in-between as a core component of survival — neither masculine nor feminine, neither male nor female, but a spectrum across which we may be empowered to choose and define ourselves for ourselves<em>.</em>” (p.11)<em> </em>Russell uses the term “fissure” as a way to consider how this glitch is something through which we can fall &#8211; like the map in <em>Hit and Run</em>, like the messy body horror transformations of Cronenberg’s horror films &#8211; what Russell calls “new possibilities of being and becoming manifest”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Creature in <em>Frankenstein</em> is a glitch in between the most existential binaries of all: that between the living and the dead. In the essay <em>Why Frankenstein’s Monster Haunts Queer Art</em> (2017), Charlie Fox writes about how Shelley’s tale “shape-shifts to suit any number of freaky interpretations”, its meaning fluid in a way that allows us to find whatever we may want from it. This, in theory, is one of the ways in which <em>Frankenstein </em>works as a trans text, a trans glitch: we can transform it into whatever we desire. Fox even references “the possibilities of male birth” inherent in how the doctor is able to create life, blurring the lines between the ways in which we understand not just gender as an idea, but also the gendered body and the meanings innate to it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The trans-ness of body horror is rooted in this idea of what the gendered body is; its meaning, limits, and boundaries. In horror, the body is constantly, relentlessly gendered, in a way that often falls prey to binary, almost essentialist ideas: the Final Girl is historically cis; the body is sexualised in binary ways – this is exaggerated in contemporary, meta-horrors like <em>The Cabin in the Woods </em>(2011) that gender their archetypal characters &#8211; stoner, slut, virgin, jock &#8211; along gendered lines. But these ideas are often challenged in body horror, narratives that are driven by transformation that pushes against the limits of how we understand the body; pushes up against the limits of the map like a glitch in <em>The Simpsons Hit and Run</em>. In <em>Videodrome </em>(1983), Max Renn’s body transforms in a way that is at once gendered and a refusal of gender as a slit emerges in his stomach and he pulls a firearm from it. This is a temporary transformation, one that comes just as soon as it goes &#8211; possibly caused by the strange signals of the Videodrome broadcast itself &#8211; as Max finds himself briefly outside of the lines of the boundary. This is to say, Max’s transformation, Max’s (trans) body is a glitch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In <em>Glitch Feminism</em>, Russell argues that the glitch is a space &#8211; which, in video gaming, it so often is; that strange world off the edge of the map &#8211; one that allows us to “innovate and experiment”, something that exists in digital spaces and allows us to explore, transform, “faster than AFK mores or the societies that produce them under which we are forced to operate offline.” (p.12)</p>



<p>This distinction between digital and physical realms also has an inherently trans undertone: in <em>Nevada</em>, Maria references the difference between cyberspace and meatspace in Gibson’s <em>Neuromancer</em> (1984). This difference is where trans-ness enters <em>The Matrix </em>(1999).&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Neo is freed from The Matrix, the computer simulation created by machines IRL as a way to turn humankind into batteries, there is a strange freedom that comes from the ways in which he returns to The Matrix; his newfound knowledge gives him access to superhuman feats and, in the film’s final act, he’s able to see and manipulate the source code of The Matrix itself. It’s like hacking, or cheating in a video game: he can learn kung-fu at a moment’s notice or transform his aesthetic into something idealised. When he and Trinity return to The Matrix to wreak havoc, they end up looking like a leather-clad T4T couple. The Matrix is also a world where glitches matter &#8211; deja vu is referred to as “a glitch in The Matrix”, a sign that something within the code, the world itself, has changed. This is another moment of slippage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A glitch in The Matrix feels akin to the trans slippages of (body) horror, a slippage between boundaries and binaries. A glitch in The Matrix serves as a reminder that it’s a construct, something being manipulated like the product of a videogame level editor. The Matrix, this constructed reality, is nothing more than a pile of code, an endless stream of 0s and 1s; a binary, repeated eternally. It’s ironic, then, that Neo becomes known as the one when he is, in reality, a glitch. This notion of The One &#8211; a defining aspect of the mythology of <em>The Matrix </em>&#8211; is surprisingly fluid, with meanings that are both messianic, and deeply romantic. For Trinity, Neo is the one because she falls in love with him, and it’s this act of love that produces a glitch in the system of The Matrix, a way for Neo and Trinity to understand themselves anew, breaking down boundaries both within The Matrix, and IRL.</p>

<p>What in-between spaces do we inhabit and what fissures do we cleave open when we perform deliberate acts of digital illegibility through subversive performances of gender, sexuality, aesthetics, and languages?

<p>I’m on a train from London to Bath. The internet on my phone is spotty. I ask to connect to the train Wi-Fi and it redirects me to a sign-up page. I sigh. The ask is transactional; I knew I would have to pay in some way for the pleasure of getting online, if not in money (my train fare notwithstanding). The form wants to know my name. It wants to know my age. It really wants to know my gender, and whether I live in the UK. It’s going to need an email address from me, sorry, if I really want to get online.</p>



<p>I’m not in the mood to comply. Refusal is already bubbling up through my throat, and my fingers pause over the keyboard, twitching and annoyed. So I don’t. The name I put down is nonsense, a keysmash; the surname is too. My date of birth becomes the 1st of April, 2004, nowhere close to my real one. (I know all the system really needs to know is that I’m above eighteen. I feed it what it wants, but give it nothing of value.) There are only two options for gender – man, woman – I pick one at random. My email address is an old one formed during my pre-teen online flash game heydays, a combination of the words ‘game’, ‘master’, and a string of numbers. It doesn’t really matter.</p>



<p>The system is satisfied. I answered its questions. It lets me get online. I feel, for a moment, triumphant at my refusal, my participation in the system in order to subvert it. I then immediately feel silly. It’s just a web form for a Wi-Fi connection. It’s not a big deal. It doesn’t really matter.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>“Well, being trans and being queer means… (laughs). Well, I think of it in a certain way. It&#8217;s like when you are playing a game. Some simple options are handed out to you. OK, well, how far do you want this slider? Like, four or five sliders are given to you. How do you want to manage your life and how do you want to customise your life, if you will. Being queer feels like living life on advanced settings. It&#8217;s so many things you have to check and options, and you have to manually reset and set and check and think about what you have never thought about in life, which many people don&#8217;t have to think about in life. Because it’s already taken care of for them. It&#8217;s already good for them. Why do they want to change? But I don&#8217;t blame them for not wanting to change it. But I also can because they – they did not want anybody to access those advanced options. So yeah, that&#8217;s how I kind of view queerness. It&#8217;s kind of this juggling of, like, multiple sliders. Like I want this much, and I want that much… I want to breathe this much air. I want to walk like this. I want to talk like this. Things that people don&#8217;t really have to think about because it is prescribed to them.”</em></p>
<cite><em>Conversation with R, 2023</em></cite></blockquote>



<p>Legacy Russell looks at glitch feminism as a form of dissent, as a refusal, as a “pushing back” against capitalism. Glitches, she says, can “show us the machinic limitations”, give us a “sense of where we might hack further in pointed undoing”.<sup data-fn="c020a5e4-061a-4496-8cca-706574641ab7" class="fn"><a href="#c020a5e4-061a-4496-8cca-706574641ab7" id="c020a5e4-061a-4496-8cca-706574641ab7-link">1</a></sup> If to glitch against the system deliberately is to hack, then to hack is to queer. Reappropriating Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick’s words, it is to “open [up the] mesh of possibilities, gaps, overlaps, dissonances and resonances, lapses and excesses of meaning”.<sup data-fn="d58876f5-42b3-464f-8206-1885229a2cbf" class="fn"><a href="#d58876f5-42b3-464f-8206-1885229a2cbf" id="d58876f5-42b3-464f-8206-1885229a2cbf-link">2</a></sup> Its potential lies, as Cathy Cohen reminds us, “in its ability to create a space in opposition to dominant norms”.<sup data-fn="98efb095-ce96-4bbb-add9-d5cfb020dc6e" class="fn"><a href="#98efb095-ce96-4bbb-add9-d5cfb020dc6e" id="98efb095-ce96-4bbb-add9-d5cfb020dc6e-link">3</a></sup> To queer our digital presence is to enact “a body that is inherently fluid, a body emancipated from ever being asked to register its traces online”. It is to “render [ourselves] useless as a subject of capital’s regime of mining and profiting from data”.<sup data-fn="9cd468d5-99d1-4c7f-ab43-9639483fa438" class="fn"><a href="#9cd468d5-99d1-4c7f-ab43-9639483fa438" id="9cd468d5-99d1-4c7f-ab43-9639483fa438-link">4</a></sup> It is to resist categorisation by becoming, if not invisible, then at least indecipherable; illegible; unreadable to the system whose goal is to extract, to define, determine, categorise and exploit.</p>



<p>In the grand scheme of things, my refusal on the train ride was trivial; a moment of childish stubbornness rather than conscious political praxis. It reminds me of what @park_slope_arsonist, an online comedian whom I’ve been following for many years, always says: I love to lie online. Why wouldn’t you lie online? she asks. Why wouldn’t you confound, contradict, create a persona that may or may not have anything to do with who you are when you’re not online?</p>



<p>I wanted to get online – something stood in the way – I resented it for standing in the way – I messed with it in turn, while still getting what I wanted out of it. But perhaps these small moments of refusal, of a lack of compliance, pave the way for more deliberate acts of illegibility, of gaming the system to escape it, of thwarting surveillance. A month before I was on that train to Bath, I was back home in India, attempting to organise a Palestine solidarity reading circle with some friends while evading governmental scrutiny and a police shutdown, which had increased manifold for anything Palestine-related over the last several months. We planned to spread the word about the reading circle online (carefully). There existed a thin space where we could play with this. It had to be immediately obvious what this was about to those we wanted there, without tipping our hand in a way that was legible to those we didn’t want there. We had to play in the space of symbols and icons. A poppy in the colours of the Palestinian flag. A watermelon against the background. A reading circle that was about “solidarity”, without explicit mention of any word or phrase that would tip off content moderators, cops, or right-wing troublemakers. A piece of digital ephemera that would expire after a period of time, and not subsist in perpetuity.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>“I guess with [platforms like] Instagram, it actually doubles your chances of being moderated in a particular way, because it&#8217;s image and text. So you have to be careful on both fronts of like, what will be seen as offensive or what will be seen as not meeting the guidelines. However, people are innately deeply creative when they want to share something. And, of course, again, that goes both ways in the good, bad, whatever. I think people have kind of learned that they have to be creative. And there&#8217;s a combination of creative and careful that is being played with, constantly both in words and in image, in order for content to be seen, important content to be seen, important content to reach the right people. But I think because it shifts so fast, it&#8217;s also a steep learning curve because the learning curve doesn&#8217;t end. Like we have to keep up with all the things that are being looked at and seen as offensive or inappropriate.”</em></p>
<cite><em>Conversation with A, 2023</em></cite></blockquote>



<p>In Sayan Bhattacharyya’s piece on Epistemically Produced Illegibility, they point out how material in non-Western languages that are nonetheless presented in Roman script suffer a sort of invisibilisation. “Data that is epistemically heterogeneous,” they say, “can become illegible within a representational scheme that enforces standardization.”<sup data-fn="adbe62e5-5a02-42d4-bf53-5dc26c4f2981" class="fn"><a href="#adbe62e5-5a02-42d4-bf53-5dc26c4f2981" id="adbe62e5-5a02-42d4-bf53-5dc26c4f2981-link">5</a></sup> They argue that our knowledge production structures need to be interrogated and reformed, to account for these oversights.</p>



<p>It strikes me as a sort of epistemic injustice, drawing on Miranda Fricker’s work.<sup data-fn="f01934c9-3a72-4c3a-a2e3-f2a1499d4bf3" class="fn"><a href="#f01934c9-3a72-4c3a-a2e3-f2a1499d4bf3" id="f01934c9-3a72-4c3a-a2e3-f2a1499d4bf3-link">6</a></sup> It reminds me of Causevic and Sengupta’s argument that the internet itself is built on a sort of digital epistemic injustice. They remind us that the “knowledges of the majority of the world – women, people of color, LGBTIQ+ folks, indigenous communities, and most of the Global South – have been marginalized, undermined, exploited, or ignored by historical and contemporary structures of power and privilege,” and that “nowhere is this more starkly obvious – and simultaneously hidden – than in the digital worlds of the internet”.<sup data-fn="45282c32-a97a-45a5-b21f-edde062acfdb" class="fn"><a href="#45282c32-a97a-45a5-b21f-edde062acfdb" id="45282c32-a97a-45a5-b21f-edde062acfdb-link">7</a></sup></p>



<p>Their arguments ring true to me. There’s a stark disparity: we undoubtedly live in an age of digital colonialism, a devaluing of knowledge that is not Western, not normative. But I also want to ask: what if we were to use epistemic illegibility as a way to hack a system that commodifies and co-opts?</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>“We’ve created a kind of liminal space where people just get to be themselves and get to create their own selves and get to understand themselves in the context of who they are, and understand their identity in the context of their experience, and not vice versa. It gives birth to a very beautiful chaos, in the middle of Instagram posts that are like very ‘Get Ready With Me’ and like, ‘girls, you should do this’ and ‘boys, you should do that’.”</em></p>
<cite><em>Conversation with L, 2023</em></cite></blockquote>



<p>What if digital epistemic illegibility became a way to resist and subvert, to slip between the cracks of a system that never existed for us in the first place? Drawing on James C. Scott’s <em>Seeing Like A State</em>,<sup data-fn="53045aad-aba7-4ce6-934a-5c13c9d1dea0" class="fn"><a href="#53045aad-aba7-4ce6-934a-5c13c9d1dea0" id="53045aad-aba7-4ce6-934a-5c13c9d1dea0-link">8</a></sup> I want to ask, what happens to digital knowledge production when queer and trans communities refuse legibility so as to become more ungovernable? What if we game the algorithm, refuse its discipline, dare to exist beyond its logics?</p>



<p>It’s a difficult trick to pull off. I might do all my browsing on incognito tabs and I might have spent a lot of time trying to confound the system so that it never serves me a relevant ad, but I’m still trying to subvert a system that wields massive amounts of control over me. It decides who I reach, how I reach them; it decides if I’m too much; it decides if I deserve the platform I have; it decides whether my reach is suspended. It decides whether to call the police. It decides whether to muzzle, to amplify, to dampen, or to simply leave me alone. More importantly, I’m trying to game a system with tools that are also available to those with oppositional political interests – tools that they can also harness towards their own interests.</p>

<p><em>“What happens is Indian trolls are very clever that way, they make homophobic, transphobic posts in regional languages [in English script].

I have reported them time and again. I have also asked for – you know, there is an option of subjective review, by a person. That has also happened and I&#8217;ve got the reply that this doesn&#8217;t go into our community guidelines. And I’m like, you fucker, you do not even know my language, how would you even do it? Or you&#8217;re using Google Translate or you are a person who is not… I don&#8217;t know how they do it. There are thousands of languages in India itself. And I feel that language plays a very important role in it. Since it is easier to address things if they are in English, because I&#8217;ll get a lot of eyeballs. But when they&#8217;re done in regional languages, it&#8217;s very difficult. And also, you know, weird way that it is, I don&#8217;t know what happens, what goes on, behind the workings of these platforms, but there are more reported posts being taken down when the person who is posting is a marginalised person.”</em></p>

<p>I’m also trying to game a system that would sooner curtail and fail me than it would those who bring it eyeballs and thus revenue whilst sticking to the status quo. In India, authoritarian governmental aims dovetail with corporate moderation measures. The right-wing Hindu nationalist government is aware of the mobilising and organising power of social media as a site for dissent; they saw it in action during the 2020-2021 farmers’ protests. Social media platforms must now comply with content take-down notices from the government, or risk being held legally and financially liable.<sup data-fn="4c55ec36-9f28-48ae-8718-2ed475ab3855" class="fn"><a href="#4c55ec36-9f28-48ae-8718-2ed475ab3855" id="4c55ec36-9f28-48ae-8718-2ed475ab3855-link">9</a></sup> India is too big of a profit-making market for social media companies to not comply.<sup data-fn="8e689375-0ae5-4368-b088-d1680f6a521f" class="fn"><a href="#8e689375-0ae5-4368-b088-d1680f6a521f" id="8e689375-0ae5-4368-b088-d1680f6a521f-link">10</a></sup></p>



<p>As such, platforms censor marginalised users – particularly Dalit Bahujan Adivasi (DBA) and Muslim users – and take down their content disproportionately, or ignore their reports of hate speech and discrimination, with such experiences heightening at the intersection of caste, class, race, gender and sexuality.<sup data-fn="f7258ec2-60fa-46e1-a5f4-8b978d77a0ca" class="fn"><a href="#f7258ec2-60fa-46e1-a5f4-8b978d77a0ca" id="f7258ec2-60fa-46e1-a5f4-8b978d77a0ca-link">11</a></sup> Platforms are more likely to take down the accounts and posts of DBA users calling out casteism or presenting dissenting views, than they are to curb the users spreading such bigotry. Contextual ignorance is a defence these platforms simply cannot claim anymore – by now, we all know that polarised reactions and content deliver the most attention and engagement, and thus bring these platforms the most money. It’s simply not in these platforms’ financial interest to curb such a windfall, and their lines of censorship align along state-corporate lines of power and surveillance.</p>

<p>And yet, we continue to be illegible. We hack. We glitch. We resist and subvert, we deliberately obfuscate, we poison the system with ‘bad data’, we perform invisibility in open sight, and we blur and muddy the waters, signalling to those we care to signal to, and turning away from those we don’t. As Russell reminds us, “glitch moves, but glitch also blocks. It incites movement while simultaneously creating an obstacle. Glitch prompts and glitch prevents. With this, glitch becomes a catalyst, opening up new pathways, allowing us to seize on new directions”. To perform digital illegibility, then, is to “celebrate failure as a generative force, a new way to take on the world”.<sup data-fn="2c14ff22-8536-4e6a-876f-4929e4a0527a" class="fn"><a href="#2c14ff22-8536-4e6a-876f-4929e4a0527a" id="2c14ff22-8536-4e6a-876f-4929e4a0527a-link">12</a></sup> To become digitally illegible is to become force and obstacle all at once, all together, in a system that would rather you did not exist, or if you did, that such existence would only serve its interests. It becomes a way to exist in a world that commodifies and co-opts. We do it because to do so is to hack the system, and to queer it, and to play in that space of dissonances and resonances that Sedgwick talks about, to revel in those “lapses and excesses of meaning.” We do it because we can, and we do it because we must.</p>
